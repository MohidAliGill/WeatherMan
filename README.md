The purpose of this repo is to help the team lead and his team member in training and evaluating newly hired developers especially fresh grads. Code written by newbies for training/practice will be checked in here and reviewed by their respective team leads. All feedback must be in written on github.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo on your local machine.
2. For every assigned task create a new branch e.g. borjanspider.
3. When the task is complete make sure the code confirms to [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
4. Push the code and create a pull request against your *master* branch.
5. Specify the title of the PR as *name-task* e.g. *Weatherman* so its easy to find in the list.

Do not add log files, temp files, data files etc.
**Good Luck**.
